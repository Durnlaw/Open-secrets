Tell about prog xp:

I am a self-taught programmer. My economics major taught me to analyze problems, but to solve them I learned Python. Python offers the flexibility to tackle most problems I run into. 

An early professional project of mine concerned the automation of an excel report. The customers' manually created report frequently resulted in human-caused inaccuracies. I worked with the customer in a one-on-one environment to gather requirements, like including a QA process to garner trust in the automated report. Once they were comfortable, the new pandas-based report took over and was moved to production.

Recently, I performed data entry duties with a political campaign. The campaign collected over ten thousand records that were entered into a browser-based system. After entering 100 names, I determined I could increase my input if I automated all non-keyboard activity. Using pyautogui, I built an algorithm in Python that input all constituent information, saved their profile, and returned to the starting page. While using this algorithm, I independently entered over one tenth of the records.

Currently, I am working on a personal project that clusters political action committees based on their voting records in Congress (through donations to Congresspeople). This project utilizes csv, urllib.request, and json to pull data, performs pandas-based ETL work, and clusters in scikit-learn. The resulting clusters help to illustrate priorities of a PAC donations. All of this work is public on github.

Social good work compelling:
Govs: Military, working with Innamo on recording
Volunteer: Plant trees, canvassing, Eagle Scout
Personal: PAC, protesting
Two sentences most reward/frustrating:

Three best qualities for team:
I listen/assume people are smart, I'm patient, I find middle grounds
Frustrating part of teamwork is factionalism.
Organizing tools to work with a team

Future plans post DSSG.
I want to be independent and confident.
