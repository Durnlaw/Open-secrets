            DM - Excel, python
            ML - Decision Tree
            Viz - Very basic in matplotlib
Reach clicker
            Prog - Keeb and mouse input
            Pol - Campaign support
Politician donations to votes

            DM - APIs, python, sqllite
            Prog - APIs
            DA - Basic means, sums, party aggregates
            	ML - There is a solution here.
            	Viz - A good bubble chart or sanky could be useful. Or a time series model
            Pol - Connection btw donations and votes
Effect of Univ Healthcare
	- Are high infant mortality rates caused by a lack of a universal health care system?
	Specifically why Infant Mortality Rate rises.
			DM - Excel
			DA - Basic means, sums, country plan understanding
				ML - This could be something as low as a regression model or decision tree/rand forest
					Consider running one hot encoding
				Viz - Potentially something visceral 
			Pol - Analysis of healthcare on country metrics
 
Quant Social Science:
	Casual Inference - understanding cause from effect
	Matching Propensity Score Matching - technique to esimate effect of policy by accounting for other covariates (in the population that aren't the target variable)
	Instrumental Variables - 
	Regression Discontinuity - Measuring causal effects of interventions at a threshold above and below the original assigned location to infer if the original assigned location is accurate
	Natural Experiments -

For fixing in future
	Some Cycles in leg_2010 come out to odd years
	Temporal consideration
	dedup the open seecrets pull. or make it better
	Change local folder name to pac_categories
